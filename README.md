# ARM_CPU
32-Bit ARM design for a 5 state pipelined cpu on the TinyFPGA Bx board.
Class project for UW CSE/EE 469: Computer Architecture I with Mark Oskin.
This cpu design is implemented by Doruk Arisoy and Ben Eastin.


To Do list:
+ Lab 1:
    - compare our code with solution, perform fixes
+ Lab 2:
    - memory
    - implement ALU
    - implement 12 instructions,
        - 3 branches, unconditional, some kind of conditional, branch link
+ Lab 3:
    - pipelining will be implemented
    - read Chapter 4.5-6 on textbook
