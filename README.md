# Pipelined ARM CPU
32-Bit ARM design for a 5 state pipelined cpu on the TinyFPGA Bx board.
Class project for UW CSE/EE 469: Computer Architecture I with Mark Oskin.
This cpu design is implemented by Doruk Arisoy and Ben Eastin.


**To Do list:**
+ Lab 1:
    - [x] register file
    - [x] read a register
    - [x] program counter
    - [ ] compare code with solution, perform fixes
+ Lab 2:
    - [ ] memory
    - [ ] write to a register
    - [ ] implement ALU
    - [ ] implement 12 instructions:
        - [ ] 3 branches: unconditional, some kind of conditional, branch link
        - [ ] add 'add r1, r2, r3', addi 'add r1, r2, #1'
+ Lab 3:
    - [ ] pipelining will be implemented
    - [ ] read Chapter 4.5-6 on textbook
